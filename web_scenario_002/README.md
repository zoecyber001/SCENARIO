# SCENARIO 002 // The Printer That Knew Too Much

**PRINTMON // Forensics Tool**

A cybersecurity simulation exploring a sophisticated attack hidden inside office printers.

## 🎬 Story

A company reports strange behavior: their office printers print cryptic messages at night.

"WHO CHECKED THE LOGS?"

No jobs. No queue. No explanation.

You investigate and discover a compromised printer fleet running a custom firmware with an embedded Python interpreter. Inside the printer's "failed scan" folder: 124 text fragments containing surveillance data.

**The printer wasn't haunted. It was weaponized.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask + Flask-SocketIO

### Installation

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
./run.sh
```

Or directly:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5000**
