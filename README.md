# SCENARIO // Series

**Visualizing theoretical cyber threats with real code.**

A collection of interactive cybersecurity simulations that bring fictional attacks to life through working code and engaging narratives.

---

## 🎬 About

**SCENARIO** is a series of educational cybersecurity demonstrations that:
- ✅ **Show, don't tell** - Working applications, not just descriptions
- ✅ **Tell stories** - Engaging narratives that make technical concepts memorable
- ✅ **Teach concepts** - Real security principles in fictional contexts
- ✅ **Use real code** - Actual implementations, not pseudocode

Each scenario is a self-contained simulation exploring a different attack vector, defense technique, or security concept.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each scenario has its own directory with:
- `README.md` - Full documentation and story
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `run.sh` - Quick launch script

```bash
# Navigate to a scenario
cd scenario_001_cortex_v9/

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run
./run.sh
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These are **fictional simulations** for educational purposes:
- No actual malware or exploits
- All threats are simulated
- No real vulnerabilities demonstrated
- Built for learning and storytelling

**Do not use for malicious purposes.**

## 🎯 Purpose

**Why SCENARIO?**

Security concepts are often abstract and hard to visualize. These simulations:
1. Make threats tangible and understandable
2. Demonstrate attack patterns interactively
3. Show how security tools work under the hood
4. Inspire curiosity about cybersecurity

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Each scenario uses different technologies:
- **TUIs** - Textual (Python)
- **Web Apps** - Flask, WebSockets, vanilla JS
- **CLI Tools** - Python, asyncio
- **Future** - React, Electron, native apps, etc.

Variety keeps things interesting and demonstrates different approaches.
